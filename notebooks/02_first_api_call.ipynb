      "### **Areas of Consideration:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Elevated LTV Ratio**\n",
      "- At 87.5%, the LTV exceeds the ideal 80% threshold\n",
      "- Recommend requiring Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) to mitigate risk\n",
      "- Consider if borrower can increase down payment to reach 80% LTV\n",
      "\n",
      "**Income-to-Loan Ratio**\n",
      "- Loan amount represents approximately 4.1x annual income\n",
      "- Within reasonable bounds but at the upper range of comfort\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Recommendation: APPROVE**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Justification:** John Smith presents a low-to-moderate credit risk profile. His strong credit score, stable employment, and manageable debt levels outweigh concerns about the higher LTV ratio. The mortgage is well-secured by real estate collateral, and his financial profile suggests ability to service the debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Terms:**\n",
      "- Require PMI due to LTV >80%\n",
